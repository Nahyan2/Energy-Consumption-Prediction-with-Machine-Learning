                                **Energy Consumption Prediction with Machine Learning**
This project focuses on predicting energy consumption using machine learning techniques.
By analyzing historical household power consumption data, the goal is to build a model that accurately forecasts future energy usage patterns.

**Project Setup and Data Loading**
We start by importing necessary libraries and loading the dataset:

**Data Exploration: Checking for Missing Values**
Before proceeding with data preprocessing and model development, it's essential to check for missing values in the dataset. 
This ensures data integrity and informs decisions on handling missing data appropriately.

**Data Preprocessing: Handling Missing Values**
To ensure data completeness for analysis and modeling, missing values in the dataset are filled with column means.

**Data Visualization: Resampled Monthly Mean Plots**
We visualize the resampled monthly mean data for selected columns to observe trends in energy consumption:

**Data Visualization: Resampled Daily Mean Plots**
To further explore the patterns in energy consumption, we visualize the resampled daily mean data for selected columns:

**Data Visualization: Resampled Hourly Mean Plots**
To delve deeper into the patterns of energy consumption, we visualize the resampled hourly mean data for selected columns:

**Data Transformation: Time Series to Supervised Learning Format**
To prepare the dataset for machine learning model training, we transform the time series data into a supervised learning format:

**Data Resampling: Hourly Mean Calculation**
To analyze energy consumption trends at an hourly level, the dataset is resampled to hourly frequency and the mean is computed:

**Data Scaling and Transformation**
To prepare the data for model training, we perform scaling, transform it into a supervised learning format, and split it into training and test sets:

**LSTM Model Training and Evaluation**
To predict energy consumption patterns, an LSTM model is trained on the preprocessed data and evaluated:

Summary:
"In the 'Energy Consumption Prediction with Machine Learning' project, we aimed to forecast energy usage patterns using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks. 
The project began with preprocessing steps to clean the dataset and resample it to hourly frequency, followed by selecting relevant features for prediction.
We developed an LSTM model with one layer of 100 units and incorporated dropout for regularization.
After training the model on historical data, we evaluated its performance using metrics like Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and visually compared predicted versus actual energy consumption trends.
Moving forward, future work includes exploring advanced LSTM architectures, incorporating additional features or external factors such as weather data, and optimizing the model for real-time predictions. 
These enhancements aim to improve the accuracy and robustness of energy consumption forecasts, supporting more efficient resource management and sustainable practices.
